* [2020-03-09 Mon] Influxdb client
  - Fell down a bit of a rabbit hole here...
  - The old InfluxDB client is no longer available, and I never
    vendored it.
    - Github issue here: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/11035
  - That issue points out that the deprecation was announced a while
    back.
  - If I really need this, I will have to copy from the Raspberry Pi
    or some such.
  - Started digging into the installed version of InfluxDB.
    - The repo that controls this is at
      /home/aardvark/software/aardvark_influxdb_grafana on Zombie.
    - From there I was able to see that I'm running version 0.12,
      which was released in 2016. OMG.
    - I'll need to upgrade that at some point....but not now.
  - As I have a working binary from whenever I compiled this last, I'm
    going to cut my losses and try adding that.
  - goal, btw, is to have this running on raspberry pi at home via
    Balena, which means running in Docker.
